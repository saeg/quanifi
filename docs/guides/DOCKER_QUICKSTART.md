# Docker quick start

A fresh clone plus `docker compose up` builds and starts a lean NiFi 2.9.0
image with twelve quantum processors pre-installed, a stopped demo canvas
already loaded, and no network calls to the NiFi API during startup. Starting
the canvas builds one Grover search from a Qiskit phase oracle and a Qiskit
Grover operator, runs it on a local Aer simulator, and writes an HTML report to
your host. The default canvas has five processors in a single sequence; no
comparison matrix or consensus configuration is needed.

The image measurements below were collected with an earlier, larger Grover demo
(nine simulated circuits) and an eight-processor image, not the current demo.
They were collected on an Apple Silicon Mac using Docker Desktop. They are
reference measurements, not performance guarantees.

## Prerequisites

- Docker Desktop with Compose v2, and `git`. No Python, no NiFi, no quantum
  libraries needed on the host to run the demo through the NiFi UI.
- **Memory**: give Docker Desktop at least **4 GB** (Settings → Resources →
  Memory on macOS/Windows); **6 GB or more** is more comfortable if you also
  run the report browser (`--profile web`) or the test profile at the same
  time. On the reference machine the container used **1.36 GiB idle** (right
  after `healthy`, before running the demo) and **2.64 GiB after** the demo
  (nine simulated circuits, incl. Qrisp's jax/jaxlib import, the single
  largest consumer at ~570 MB). A run capped to exactly 4 GB (`docker update
  --memory 4g --memory-swap 4g`) still passed, peaking at 2.38 GiB (60% of
  the cap).
- **Disk**: a few GB free — the runtime image (**3.9 GB on disk, 1.37 GB
  compressed** on the reference machine), the NAR unpack inside the
  container's writable layer (~1 GB, done once per fresh container), and
  Docker's build cache.
- Network access during the build: the base image, the pinned `uv` image and
  every dependency wheel are pulled from Docker Hub / ghcr.io / PyPI. The
  build is not reproducible offline.

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/saeg/quanifi.git quanifi
cd quanifi
docker compose up
```

Wait for `(healthy)` in `docker compose ps`, or the `[quanifi] READY` line in
the logs (`docker compose logs -f nifi | grep quanifi` — the foreground
`docker compose up` is otherwise verbose, since the official image tails
`nifi-app.log`). On the reference machine (Apple Silicon, arm64) the first
build took **~1 minute** on a fast connection, and a fresh container reached
`healthy` in **~30 seconds**; build time depends on network speed, and startup time depends on host resources.

Open <https://localhost:8443/nifi>, accept the self-signed certificate, and
log in with:

- **Username**: `admin`
- **Password**: `quanifipassword`

## Run the demo

1. On the canvas, right-click **Quanifi quickstart — Qiskit Grover** and choose
   **Start**. Double-click the group to see this single flow:

   **Start here → Phase oracle → Grover operator → Simulate circuit → View results**

2. Each step has one purpose:
   - **Start here** sends an empty input to start the flow.
   - **Phase oracle** (`QiskitPhaseOracle`) marks the target `10` with a −1 phase
     on two qubits, setting it apart from `00`, `01`, and `11`.
   - **Grover operator** (`QiskitGroverOperator`) puts both qubits in an equal
     superposition and applies one Grover iteration (the oracle plus the diffuser),
     which amplifies the marked state.
   - **Simulate circuit** runs the circuit locally using Qiskit Aer (1,024 shots).
   - **View results** writes the circuit and measurement results to HTML.
3. Open `reports/quickstart/qiskit-grover.html` on your computer. The expected
   top result is **10**, with probability **1.0** on the ideal simulator.
   Bitstrings use qubit 0 on the left.

The trigger runs immediately when started and then once per day while left
running. For another immediate run, stop **Start here**, leave the other four
processors running, then right-click **Start here → Run Once**. Each run adds
one result card to the report.

To try another search, stop **Phase oracle**, edit its **Marked State**
to another two-bit value (for example `01`), and start it again before triggering
the flow. Keep **Num Iterations** on **Grover operator** at `1` for this two-qubit
example. Failed inputs are retained in the connections to the failure funnel for
inspection. The oracle and operator exchange OpenQASM 2, so either box can be
replaced by its Cirq counterpart (`CirqPhaseOracle`, `CirqGroverOperator`, both
included in the image; set the Cirq box's **Output Format** to `qasm2`). See
[Interchangeable Grover](INTERCHANGEABLE_GROVER_FLOW.md).

### Headless check

After NiFi is healthy, the following starts the flow, checks the new report for
`10` with probability at least 0.99, and stops the flow again:

```bash
python3 tools/quickstart_smoke.py --base-url https://127.0.0.1:8443/nifi-api
```

Use your configured host port in the URL (for example `18443`). Add
`--check-only` to confirm the canvas is present and stopped without running it.
The smoke check expects the default target `10`.

### Existing installations

An existing installation keeps its old canvas. The canvas lives in
`conf/flow.json.gz` inside the `nifi-conf` volume, and the entrypoint only
seeds the image's canvas when that file is absent. `docker compose up --build`
therefore updates the image (including newly added processors) but not the
canvas you see. To get the new default canvas, either:

- reset with `docker compose down -v` and then `docker compose up --build`. This
  deletes every NiFi volume, including flows you built and queued data; the host
  `reports/` directory is a bind mount and is kept; or
- keep your flows: after `docker compose up --build`, stop and delete the old
  **Quanifi quickstart — Qiskit Grover** group, then drag a Process Group onto
  the canvas, choose the option to upload a flow definition, and select
  `demo/grover/qiskit-grover.json`.

## Configuration

Every variable below can be set in the shell or in a `.env` file next to
`compose.yaml`.

| Variable | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `QUANIFI_NIFI_PORT` | `8443` | Host port mapped to NiFi's HTTPS port. |
| `QUANIFI_NIFI_USERNAME` | `admin` | NiFi single-user login username. |
| `QUANIFI_NIFI_PASSWORD` | `quanifipassword` | NiFi single-user login password. |
| `QUANIFI_SENSITIVE_PROPS_KEY` | `quanifi-quickstart-demo-key` | NiFi encryption key for sensitive properties. Set a private key before storing real credentials; retain it with the existing flow. |
| `QUANIFI_NIFI_HEAP` | `1g` | JVM initial and max heap (`NIFI_JVM_HEAP_INIT`/`_MAX`). |
| `QUANIFI_REPORTS_DIR` | `./reports` | Host directory bind-mounted at the container's `reports/`. |
| `QUANIFI_PROCESSORS` | `docker/processors.txt` | Path (inside the repo) to the processor list to bake in, or `all`. Rebuild after changing. |
| `QUANIFI_PREBAKE` | `true` | Pre-install dependencies at build time. Set `false` (with `QUANIFI_PROCESSORS=all`) to let NiFi install on first use instead — slower, needs network at runtime. |
| `QUANIFI_CANVAS` | `demo/grover/qiskit-grover.json` | Flow definition baked into the image; empty string (`QUANIFI_CANVAS=`) ships no canvas. |
| `QUANIFI_AUTO_RECOVER` | `true` | Auto-restart NiFi on a detected startup wedge (bounded, see below). |
| `QUANIFI_AUTO_RESUME` | `false` | Opt in to NiFi resuming `RUNNING` components after a restart. **Also disables auto-recovery** when set `true` (see below). |
| `QUANIFI_MAX_RECOVERIES` | `3` | Bounded retries for automatic wedge recovery. |
| `QUANIFI_STALL_SECONDS` | `240` | Seconds of no progress after "Starting Flow Controller" before a stall is declared. |
| `QUANIFI_WEB_PORT` | `8080` | Host port mapped to the report browser (`--profile web`). |
| `QUANIFI_ADMIN_EMAIL` | `admin@example.com` | Report browser's bootstrap administrator email. |
| `QUANIFI_ADMIN_PASSWORD` | `quanifipassword` | Report browser's bootstrap administrator password. |
| `REPORT_INGESTION_TOKEN` | `local-ingestion-token` | Bearer token the report browser accepts on `/api/v1/report-runs/`. |
| `DJANGO_SECRET_KEY` | `local-only-development-key` | Report browser's Django secret key. |
| `QUANIFI_DB_PASSWORD` | `local-only-password` | Postgres password for the report browser's database. |

NiFi re-applies `QUANIFI_NIFI_USERNAME`/`QUANIFI_NIFI_PASSWORD` on every container start, so a changed value (including the new default `quanifipassword`, which replaced `quanifi-demo-password`) takes effect after `docker compose up -d`. The report browser creates its administrator only once: to apply a changed `QUANIFI_ADMIN_PASSWORD` to an existing account, run `docker compose --profile web run --rm web python manage.py bootstrap_admin --reset-password`.

## Stopping and resetting

- `docker compose down` stops the container but **keeps every volume**,
  including the canvas in `conf/`.
- `docker compose down -v` also removes the volumes — the next `up` starts
  from a fresh, unconfigured NiFi, and the canvas is re-seeded.
- After pulling new code: `docker compose up --build`. Because `conf/` is a
  volume, the entrypoint re-applies `nifi.properties` settings on every start
  but **never overwrites an existing `flow.json.gz`** — so a changed demo
  canvas only takes effect after `docker compose down -v`.

## Restarts never resume anything

NiFi 2.9.0's `autoResumeState` controls whether components that were
`RUNNING` before a restart resume automatically afterwards. The entrypoint
sets it to `false` on every start (including an automatic wedge-recovery
restart), so **every restart leaves the canvas `STOPPED`**, regardless of
what state it was in before. This closes a real hazard: a NiFi process that
restarts with `autoResumeState=true` re-fires every `RUNNING` group
immediately, which on a canvas that submits to real quantum hardware means
spending quota twice for one restart. Set `QUANIFI_AUTO_RESUME=true` to opt
out of this protection (NiFi's normal behaviour) — doing so also disables
automatic wedge recovery, since a recovery restart with auto-resume enabled
would itself be exactly that hazard.

## Adding processors to the image

> **The Docker quickstart does not install the full processor catalogue.**
> Only the classes in [`docker/processors.txt`](https://github.com/saeg/quanifi/blob/main/docker/processors.txt)
> are included. A processor documented elsewhere may therefore be missing from
> NiFi's Add Processor dialog until you rebuild the image with it enabled.

### Enable selected processors (recommended)

Edit `docker/processors.txt` and add one existing processor class name per line,
without `.py`. For example, append `QiskitQFTCircuit` to enable that processor. Keep the
existing entries so your saved flows continue to work. Then rebuild and recreate
NiFi:

```bash
docker compose up -d --build nifi
```

Wait until NiFi is healthy, refresh the canvas, and find the new class in
**Add Processor**. Existing flows are preserved and start stopped. Adding a class
to the image makes it available; it does not add it to your canvas automatically.
A plain `docker compose restart` does not rebuild the image.

### Choose a separate list using .env

To keep your own selection separate, copy `docker/processors.txt` to
`docker/my-processors.txt`, then add class names to the copy. Add or update this
setting in `.env` beside `compose.yaml`, keeping any existing settings:

```dotenv
QUANIFI_PROCESSORS=docker/my-processors.txt
QUANIFI_PREBAKE=true
```

Run `docker compose up -d --build nifi`. The list must be inside the repository.
Keeping it under `docker/` includes it in the build context; a list elsewhere
must also be permitted by `.dockerignore` and copied into the Dockerfile's
selection stage. List processor classes only, not helper modules.

### Make all processors available

For the complete catalogue, set these values in the same local `.env` file:

```dotenv
QUANIFI_PROCESSORS=all
QUANIFI_PREBAKE=false
```

Then run `docker compose up -d --build nifi`. This copies every processor in
`nifi_extensions/`; NiFi installs dependencies as it loads the processors.
Startup can take substantially longer and requires network access and more
resources. Framework-specific external services, credentials, or hardware access
still need their own configuration. Selecting all processors does not configure
those services.

### Dependency and extension details

- With `QUANIFI_PREBAKE=true` (the default), dependencies are installed during
  the build using `uv.lock` and the overrides in `pyproject.toml`. With pre-baking
  disabled, NiFi installs the dependencies declared by each processor at runtime.
- Helper modules such as `reporting.py` are picked up automatically.
- A processor must not import another processor module: NiFi loads processors
  in isolated module contexts. The image build rejects these imports.
- To implement a new processor class, see [Creating processors](CREATING_PROCESSORS.md),
  then include its class name in your Docker selection and rebuild.

## Report browser (`--profile web`)

```bash
docker compose --profile web up
```

Starts Postgres and the Django report browser, running migrations and the
administrator bootstrap automatically on start. Open
<http://localhost:8080/>, log in with `QUANIFI_ADMIN_EMAIL` /
`QUANIFI_ADMIN_PASSWORD` (defaults above).

QuanifiReport is **not** wired to the web profile by default: it ships with
`Output Mode` = `Local HTML`, and its `Reports API Token` property is
*sensitive*, so NiFi will not let a token be baked into the committed
`flow.json.gz` in plain text. `Reports API URL` and `Reports API Token` now
default to the working Compose values (`http://web:8080/api/v1/report-runs/`
and `local-ingestion-token`, the default of `REPORT_INGESTION_TOKEN`), so to
wire a QuanifiReport instance on the canvas to the browser you only need to
set on that processor:

- `Output Mode` = `Both` (or `Web API` to skip the local HTML file)

For non-local use, override `Reports API URL` and `Reports API Token` (and set
a matching `REPORT_INGESTION_TOKEN` for the `web` service).

Both services share the Compose project's network, and `web` is already in
`DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS`.

For live-reloading development on the report browser's own code (not part of
the quick start):

```bash
docker compose -f compose.yaml -f compose.web-dev.yaml --profile web up
```

## Tests in Docker (`--profile test`)

```bash
docker compose --profile test build test
docker compose --profile test run --rm test
```

Runs the modules listed in `docker/test-files.txt` — the tests whose imports
are fully satisfied by the processors in `docker/processors.txt` and their
pinned dependencies — inside a venv built the same way the runtime image's
per-processor venvs are (one venv, the union of every shipped processor's
dependencies, plus pytest). This is deliberately a small subset: a
full-suite test image would need the entire research stack (pyQuil +
rigetti-quax, Braket, the Q#/QDK toolchain, PennyLane, OpenFermion + PySCF,
IQM), several GB beyond what the lean quickstart needs. The full suite
already runs on the host with `just test`.

## What goes into the images

`.dockerignore` is a strict **allowlist**: it starts with `*` (deny
everything), then re-allows only the paths an image actually `COPY`s, then
re-denies a set of secret-shaped patterns (`*token*`, `*key*`, `*credential*`,
`.env*`, certificate/keystore extensions, `db.sqlite3`) even inside an
allowed directory. This matters because this working tree can hold real
provider credential files (IBM/IQM/Open Quantum key and token files) whose
names follow no single convention — the allowlist means a new credential file
dropped anywhere in the repo never reaches a build context by default,
instead of relying on remembering to add it to a denylist.

To audit what a build would actually send, from a clean clone:

```bash
docker build --no-cache --progress=plain -f - . <<'EOF'
FROM busybox:1.36
COPY . /ctx
RUN find /ctx -type f | sort
EOF
```

A previous audit with eight decoy credential files found none in the build
context. Repeat this check after changing the allowlist.

## Troubleshooting

**Wedged start.** NiFi 2.9's Python bridge can occasionally hang during
startup (the "py4j startup wedge") — no more Python processors load and the
Flow Controller never finishes initializing. The log-only monitor
(`docker/nifi/quanifi_monitor.py`) detects this without ever calling the NiFi
API (which would itself risk triggering the same wedge): if `QUANIFI_STALL_SECONDS`
pass with no new "Successfully loaded Python Processor" record and no install
progress after "Starting Flow Controller" was logged, it kills the NiFi JVMs,
the container exits non-zero, and Compose's `restart: on-failure:5` starts it
again — up to `QUANIFI_MAX_RECOVERIES` times. Because `autoResumeState=false`
on every start, a recovered start always comes back with the canvas
`STOPPED`: nothing re-fires.

- Check the current state: `docker compose exec nifi cat /tmp/quanifi/status.json`.
- Watch the monitor's own messages: `docker compose logs -f nifi | grep quanifi`.
- If recovery is exhausted (`recovery limit reached (N/N)`), the health check
  reports `unhealthy` and stays that way; a manual `docker compose restart
  nifi` resets the recovery counter (a fresh container start) and is safe for
  the same reason automatic recovery is safe — the canvas never auto-resumes.

**Port already in use.** The default ports (8443, 8080) may collide with
another NiFi or web service on your machine. Override
`QUANIFI_NIFI_PORT`/`QUANIFI_WEB_PORT`.

**Out of memory.** An exit code of 137 (visible in `docker compose ps` or
`docker inspect`) means the kernel OOM-killed the container. Check
`docker stats` while the demo runs and increase Docker Desktop's memory
limit (see Prerequisites).

**Permission denied writing to `reports/` on Linux.** The container runs as
uid 1000. If your host `reports/` directory is owned by a different uid,
`mkdir -p reports && sudo chown 1000:1000 reports` (or run
`id -u`/`id -g` and match those). The entrypoint logs a warning at startup if
`reports/` is not writable.

**A newly added processor is stuck "Initializing" after
`QUANIFI_PREBAKE=false`.** NiFi is downloading that processor's dependencies
from PyPI on first use; this needs network access from inside the container
and can take a while for a large dependency tree. Watch
`docker compose logs -f nifi` for `Installing dependencies` lines.

**Canvas shows components NiFi calls invalid / the monitor reports
`broken: canvas uses processor types not baked into this image`.** The
`conf/flow.json.gz` volume was seeded by a different image build than the one
now running (for example, you changed `docker/processors.txt` and rebuilt
without `down -v`). Run `docker compose down -v` to get a canvas that matches
the current image, then `docker compose up` again.

**Apple Silicon vs amd64.** The image builds and runs natively on
`linux/arm64`. An `amd64` build was verified under Docker Desktop's Rosetta
translation (`docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64 -f
docker/nifi/Dockerfile --target runtime ...`): it succeeded in **~2m20s** on
the reference machine, and an optional full run under emulation reached
`healthy` in **~1 minute** and passed the nine-circuit Grover demo shipped at the time (all 9 cells `110`, PASS). These timings are specific to that machine.
